I started to work on FCC Twitch JSON API project... So I thought I have to read more about Fetch API.
Spend some hours on reading articles about Fetch API, REST API, Promises and CORS.

**Good Articles:**

### R1D14
Solved some 'Intermediate Algorithm Scripting' challenges on freecodecamp.   
Also read 2 more DOM tutorials on javascript.info. Really helped me for a better understanding of DOM and how it works.

### R1D15
Spent some hours solving more FreeCodeCamp and DOM challenges.

**Interesting tasks:**
* [Create a calendar](http://javascript.info/task/calendar-table)
* [Sort the table](http://javascript.info/task/sort-table)

### R1D16

Finished "Coordinates" tutorial on javascript.info

### R1D21
Started to read "Introduction into Events" chapter of javascript.info. (Completed "Introduction to browser events" section)  
Solved some FCC algorithm challenges!

**Interesting challenges:**
* [spinal-tap-case](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/spinal-tap-case)
* [Steamroller](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/steamroller)
* [Move the ball across the field](http://javascript.info/task/move-ball-field)
* [Carousel](http://javascript.info/task/carousel)

### R1D22
Read "Bubbling and capturing" and "Event delegation" tutorials on javascript.info. And more FCC challenges...

**Thoughts:** Event delegation and Behavior patterns were really interesting. I should read more about different design patterns and how to solve common problems.

### R1D23
Finished "Introduction into Events" chapter of javascript.info. I learnt how to dispatch custom events for UI testing purposes.  
Spent some hours improving statistics template of UICE alumni site!

**Interesting tutorials:**
* [Dispatching custom events](http://javascript.info/dispatch-events)

### R1D24
I decided to get the FCC Front End Development Certification! So I got back to where I left before... Finished "HTML5 and CSS" section! ^_^  
Also started the "Events in details" chapter of javascript.info.

### R1D25
Finished "Responsive Design with Bootstrap" section of FCC.  
Also gone through "Mouse events basics" & "Moving: mouseover/out, mouseenter/leave" sections of javascript.info. 

**Thoughts:** I never liked Bootstrap... It's really a great css framework for aggressive deadlines but in my opinion, the more you use it, the more it limits your creativity! (I know you can modify it and apply your own styles but for beginners it's like a pitfall).  
You start to memorize some class names, put every thing inside div.row and add lots of classes for every single thing, and all of the projects look the same.  
I really love to build and style my own components from scratch and play with diffrent css properties to find what looks the best! (It takes more time but really helps you to better understand how things work.)

### R1D26
Finally I decided to learn how to use Gulp. It wasn't that much hard and complex.  
Played around with Globbing in Node, BrowserSync and more gulp plugins...!

**Good article:**
[Gulp for Beginners by Zell Liew](https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/)

### R1D27
Done jQuery section of FCC and a little more experiments with Gulp.

### R1D28
Done a few challenges on FCC and read "Drag'n'Drop with mouse events" section on javascript.info! (Done 1 of 2 related tasks)

### R1D29
Watched "The Beginner's Guide to ReactJS" by Kent C. Dodds to review the basics of React!
  
**Thoughts:** There's a UI Develop competition tomorrow, so I got to be prepared. (I actually want to implement the questions with vanilla JS but maybe using frameworks like React has extra score! ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯)

### R1D30
Finished "Drag'n'Drop with mouse events", "Keyboard: keydown and keyup" and "Scrolling" tutorials on javascript.info.

**Interesting Tasks:**
* [Drag superheroes around the field](http://javascript.info/task/drag-heroes)
* [Extended hotkeys](http://javascript.info/task/check-sync-keydown)
* **[All tasks of scroll lesson](http://javascript.info/onscroll)**

### R1D31
Finished "Basic JavaScript" section of FCC Front-End Dev Cert.  
**Thoughts:** I was busy preparing information on registration page and designing posters for the course that I'm going to hold at university... So that's all I did for today!

### R1D32 *
I was really busy and could not code for at least 1 hour. Just attempted to solve some FCC but didn't have the feeling... :(  

### R1D33
Finished FCC "Intermediate Algorithm Scripting" section!

**Interesting challenges:**

### R1D40
Started to read "Forms, controls" chapter of javascript.info.

### R1D41
Finished "Focusing: focus/blur" section on javascript.info

### R1D42
Taught basics of Front-End technologies to some of my friends!  
Designed and implemented a simple profile page (Explained and coded for about 2 hours in that class.)

**Thoughts:** It's really hard to teach in front of others. But teaching is a great way to strength the things you know and if others understand things you teach, that means you fully understood it.

### R1D43 *
Spent some hours solving algorithmic assignments! (I wrote some pseudo code on the paper, it counts as code, isn't it? :))

### R1D44
Finished "Forms, controls" chapter on javascript.info.

**Intersting task:**
* [Edit TD on click](http://javascript.info/task/edit-td-click)

### R1D45 **
Almost no code for today, just explored some github trending repositories. Probably have to code for more than 100 days to actually finish the challenge.

### R1D46
Built "FCC Tribute Page" project. A trubute about Dennis Ritchie, the father of C programming language.

**Link to work:** [https://codepen.io/sajadhsm/pen/YeJKWe](https://codepen.io/sajadhsm/pen/YeJKWe)

### R1D47
Learnt about Bezier curve and De Casteljau’s algorithm. Played with different curve points and timing functions. Its use cases are wonderful.

### R1D48
My friends asked me to explain flexbox in details... So I spent hours study about flexbox in details and did some experiments with diffrent properties. Also gone throw Bootstrap documentations to remind what was the classes and how to implement them and built some simple pages.  

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap 4 has changed alot and I really like their styles. Maybe I should give it try and use it more. (I knew what I said about it on Day25 but at that moment I was talking about version 3 :D)

### R1D49
Taught my friends more about HTML/CSS. (Flex box in details, position property, pseudo classes, HTML5 new tags, semantic HTML and many other tags and properties...).  
Also talked about responsive design and introdused Bootstrap. We will work more on Bootstrap in next session and then move toward JS world.

**Thoughts:** Teaching is much harder than I thought. Each person learn in a diffrent way and you have to explain same thing in diffrent ways! But the more you think about how to explain, it actually helps you undrestand the subject deeply.


### R1D50
Implemented a simple football field using HTML/CSS. Actually it's a project for my students to learn how to build basic shapes with css properties and position them where ever they want.  

**Thoughts:** Probably we will add more features like drag n drop to it via Javascript. These kind of projects are really interesting. At the first sight they may look useless but gives you ideas about what you can do with tools you have.

### R1D51
Finished "CSS animations" section on javascript.info!

### R1D52
Coded some Assembly in QtSpim. I had an assignment to determine the assembly codes of given register information and also convert C top level code to assembly. It was hard at first but really fun!

### R1D53
Read about "Strassen" algorithem and tried to implement it in javascript.

### R1D54
Recorded 3 videoes about CSS flexbox, position, transform, transition, animation, ... for my students.

**Thoughts:** Teaching in the class seems easier :)). It took about 4 hours to record 2 hours of video!!!
