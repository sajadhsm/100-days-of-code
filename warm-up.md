### Day22
Read "Bubbling and capturing" and "Event delegation" tutorials on javascript.info. And more FCC challenges...

**Thoughts:** Event delegation and Behavior patterns were really interesting. I should read more about different design patterns and how to solve common problems.

### Day23
Finished "Introduction into Events" chapter of javascript.info. I learnt how to dispatch custom events for UI testing purposes.  
Spent some hours improving statistics template of UICE alumni site!

**Interesting tutorials:**

### Day24
I decided to get the FCC Front End Development Certification! So I got back to where I left before... Finished "HTML5 and CSS" section! ^_^  
Also started the "Events in details" chapter of javascript.info.

### Day25
Finished "Responsive Design with Bootstrap" section of FCC.  
Also gone through "Mouse events basics" & "Moving: mouseover/out, mouseenter/leave" sections of javascript.info. 

**Thoughts:** I never liked Bootstrap... It's really a great css framework for aggressive deadlines but in my opinion, the more you use it, the more it limits your creativity! (I know you can modify it and apply your own styles but for beginners it's like a pitfall).  
You start to memorize some class names, put every thing inside div.row and add lots of classes for every single thing, and all of the projects look the same.  
I really love to build and style my own components from scratch and play with diffrent css properties to find what looks the best! (It takes more time but really helps you to better understand how things work.)

### Day26
Finally I decided to learn how to use Gulp. It wasn't that much hard and complex.  
Played around with Globbing in Node, BrowserSync and more gulp plugins...!

**Good article:**
[Gulp for Beginners by Zell Liew](https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/)

### Day27

Watched "The Beginner's Guide to ReactJS" by Kent C. Dodds to review the basics of React!
  
**Thoughts:** There's a UI Develop competition tomorrow, so I got to be prepared. (I actually want to implement the questions with vanilla JS but maybe using frameworks like React has extra score! ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯)

### Day30
Finished "Drag'n'Drop with mouse events", "Keyboard: keydown and keyup" and "Scrolling" tutorials on javascript.info.

**Interesting Tasks:**
* [Drag superheroes around the field](http://javascript.info/task/drag-heroes)

### Day40
Started to read "Forms, controls" chapter of javascript.info.

### Day41
Finished "Focusing: focus/blur" section on javascript.info

### Day42
Taught basics of Front-End technologies to some of my friends!  
Designed and implemented a simple profile page (Explained and coded for about 2 hours in that class.)

**Thoughts:** It's really hard to teach in front of others. But teaching is a great way to strength the things you know and if others understand things you teach, that means you fully understood it.

### Day43 *
Spent some hours solving algorithmic assignments! (I wrote some pseudo code on the paper, it counts as code, isn't it? :))

### Day44
Finished "Forms, controls" chapter on javascript.info.

**Intersting task:**
* [Edit TD on click](http://javascript.info/task/edit-td-click)

### Day45 **
Almost no code for today, just explored some github trending repositories. Probably have to code for more than 100 days to actually finish the challenge.

### Day46
Built "FCC Tribute Page" project. A trubute about Dennis Ritchie, the father of C programming language.

**Link to work:** [https://codepen.io/sajadhsm/pen/YeJKWe](https://codepen.io/sajadhsm/pen/YeJKWe)

### Day47
Learnt about Bezier curve and De Casteljau’s algorithm. Played with different curve points and timing functions. Its use cases are wonderful.

### Day48
My friends asked me to explain flexbox in details... So I spent hours study about flexbox in details and did some experiments with diffrent properties. Also gone throw Bootstrap documentations to remind what was the classes and how to implement them and built some simple pages.  

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap 4 has changed alot and I really like their styles. Maybe I should give it try and use it more. (I knew what I said about it on Day25 but at that moment I was talking about version 3 :D)

### Day49
Taught my friends more about HTML/CSS. (Flex box in details, position property, pseudo classes, HTML5 new tags, semantic HTML and many other tags and properties...).  
Also talked about responsive design and introdused Bootstrap. We will work more on Bootstrap in next session and then move toward JS world.

**Thoughts:** Teaching is much harder than I thought. Each person learn in a diffrent way and you have to explain same thing in diffrent ways! But the more you think about how to explain, it actually helps you undrestand the subject deeply.


### Day50
Implemented a simple football field using HTML/CSS. Actually it's a project for my students to learn how to build basic shapes with css properties and position them where ever they want.  

**Thoughts:** Probably we will add more features like drag n drop to it via Javascript. These kind of projects are really interesting. At the first sight they may look useless but gives you ideas about what you can do with tools you have.

### Day51
Finished "CSS animations" section on javascript.info!

### Day52
Coded some Assembly in QtSpim. I had an assignment to determine the assembly codes of given register information and also convert C top level code to assembly. It was hard at first but really fun!

### Day53
Read about "Strassen" algorithem and tried to implement it in javascript.

### Day54
Recorded 3 videoes about CSS flexbox, position, transform, transition, animation, ... for my students.

**Thoughts:** Teaching in the class seems easier :)). It took about 4 hours to record 2 hours of video!!!

### Day55
Completed Quera Front-End warmup challenges. (The main competition will hold on friday)
Read about @media queries in detail to teach responsive design fundamentals tomorrow in the class.

### Day56
Taught responsive design fundementals. Turned a fixed size layout to responsive page step by step. Then build the same layout with Bootstrap.  
Also I discuqed how to build the football field assignment.

### Day57
Learnt basics of HTML Canvas and did some simple graphics on it!  
(Also noticed there's no previous sibling selector in CSS but there will be a :has() pseudo class in the spec)

### Day58
Participated in Quera Front-End competition and got 5th place!

**Thoughts:** The questions were easy. If I was a little faster I could be on top 3 ...

### Day59
More Assembly codes on QtSpim...!

### Day60
Finally learnt basic features of Vue.js core :)

**Thoughts:** I really need a project to work on it. Learning by doing a real project is the best way to achive new abillities!

### Day61
More experiments with Vue.js  
(and built a simple responsive layout as an example for my students!!)

### Day62
More study on Vue.js documentations.

### Day63
Read more Vue documentation. Tring to master the essential parts and then pick a project and code it in Vue.

### Day64

### Day72
Started to learn Node.js! Learnt the basics like built in modules (os, fs, path, ...)  
I want to build a simple registeration service. I like to use Vuejs for frontend and Nodejs as backend.

### Day73
Learnt more about Node.js! Built a simple web server using http module, then built a better one using Express. (Get and Post methods, validating request body using Joi)

### Day74
More study on Nodejs... Built a simple API service and stored the data in a file (as a data base ^_^)

### Day75
Used Vue.js for view of my express API...! The express middlewares are really awesome :D  

**Thoughts:** After searching for tutorials, I can say that the offical documentations are the best!

### Day76
Started to read "Promises, async/await" chapter of javascript.info! Finished "Introduction: callbacks" lesson. (Awesome examples for error first callbacks)
Also learnt the basics of creating a chrome extention.  
And watched "Click Drag Scroll" (javascript30 by Wes Bos)

### Day78
I came with idea of a bot which transform different Persian typing styles to official one.  
So I made a telegram bot that is able to convert finglish to farsi for now. I have to add features like inline mode, other transformations and ...  

Unfortunately I have to go to vacation, so in next few days it's hard to code! :(

### Day79
Watched and code Python basics tutorial on the way. (For my computer architure assembler project)

### Day80
Finally had a chance to sit behind the laptop. I exercied a little Python, then read more about express routing on devdocs offline! Improved the simple API I built earlier, also built a simple database :))

### Challenge failed :(

I could not code during the vacation and I failed the challenge. Last 80 days were really enjoyable and I learnt many things. I will join the challenge in the future and hope that time I finish it.

Since It doesn't count as a round I change the title to "WARM UP" :)
